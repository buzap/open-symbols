# Font Awesome SF Symbols

This directory contains SF Symbols converted from the Font Awesome V6 icons. Only Font Awesome Free icons are included.

For icons in the solid icon set that have a corresponding icon in the regular icon set, the symbol for the solide icon is named with a `.fill` suffix, so that it can be used with the SwiftUI [`symbolVariant(_:)` modifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/symbolvariant(_:)).

## License

The symbols are licensed under the [CC BY 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), same as the icons in the Font Awesome Free icon set.
